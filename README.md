# Oktana Challenge

## Requirements
* node `^4.5.0`
* yarn `^0.17.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

### Install from source

First, clone the project:

$ git clone https://github.com/ManuelOktana/challenge.git <my-project-name>
$ cd <my-project-name>
```

```bash
$ yarn install    # Install project dependencies
$ yarn start      # Compile and launch (same as `npm start`)
```

### Run Tests

```bash
$ yarn test    
or
$ npm test
